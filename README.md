## HTTP Client is Pretty much done
	* For testing and shit ./http_client k demo.borland.com 80 /testsite/stadyn_largepagewithimages.html
	* Idk how much of a dick he's gonna be about testing this so may want to check for more weird cases
	* I think we need to edit out the http headers in the response

## HTTP Server1 is Pretty much done
	* there's a lot of error checking that isn't done
